# Recursive-Tree-Depth-Calculator

##
Imagine we have a hierarchical structure:

After creating this object, we can add new Branch type objects into branches
variable. Doing so we increase object depth by one. Into created objects we can
add again new branches etc. In the figure below we have similar structure. This
structure depth is 5.

Please write a program, where you would create similar structure. Pass this structure into your own
created method and calculate the depth of provided structure. Main requirement to complete this task: use
recursion.


---

This program creates a Branch object as the root of the tree structure, and then adds child Branch objects to it in a tree-like fashion. The CalculateDepth method recursively traverses the tree structure and finds the maximum depth of the branches. Finally, the program outputs the depth of the tree structure.
